Internship Tracker
Internship Tracker is a simple full-stack application built with:

Node.js & Express (backend API)

MongoDB (data storage)

HTML + Bootstrap (frontend)

It allows users to:

âœ… Register and log in
âœ… Add internships with title, company, location, and description
âœ… Edit and delete their internships
âœ… See a list of internships

Limitations (Current State)
ðŸ‘‰ Currently, all internship data is shown to any logged-in user, because I have not yet added user-based data filtering on the backend. This means everyone sees the same internship entries rather than private user-specific entries.

For now, this is acceptable in a demo environment, but in the future I plan to add proper user-based filtering to ensure each user only sees their own internships.

Next Steps
ðŸ“Œ I plan to host this on a platform like Render (for the API) and Netlify (for the frontend) so it can be accessed online, rather than only on my local machine (localhost).

Stay tuned for that update!
